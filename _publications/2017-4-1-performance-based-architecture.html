  <b> Abstract </b>
  <p> This paper presents research on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) in architectural design with the goal of both improving and partially automating the design process as well as the design outcomes in terms of geometry and environmental performance. The work is based upon research on agent based modeling and simulation techniques (ABMS), and the combination of analytical and optimization methods with geometric modeling and user centered design. The motivation is to render more accessible the exploration of the generative aspect of bottom up design techniques when coupled with optimization and performance criteria. The objective of the work is to develop and test a design methodology, which enables designers to explore larger sets of informed solutions by coupling design requirements and generative design techniques with validated simulations (i.e., environmental analysis) based partly on the inclusion of user light preferences early in the design process. The development of the proposed methodology and the implementation of the design system for a building façade are described, while the robustness and validity of the framework is initially tested by applying it to the generation and optimization of façade panel configurations of an office building. The results show that the MAS for design system can generate unique design configurations that perform environmentally (daylight factor analysis) better than a façade with normative façade shading.</p>
