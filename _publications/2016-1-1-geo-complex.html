<b> Abstract </b>
<p> This paper presents the continuing development of research into the applicability, customization and evaluation of a multi-agent systems approach for architectural design. The research describes the system architecture of a bespoke generative and multi-objective optimization design system and computational workflow. Through the use of the system a large solution space of fa√ßade designs are generated and ranked in an automated fashion for their improvement in their affect on lighting distribution, intensity, and efficiency. The paper presents the evolution from framework to implemented methodology, the initial in depth experimental design, experimental results, and provides discussion of the analysis of design process and design product improvements. The paper then presents a set of next steps for incorporation of further parameters of relevance to our interest in defending complex geometry for improving building performance. The research culminates with an argument in which we attempt to articulate the benefits of highly intricate geometry as not only a feasible but as well potentially more optimal approach within contemporary architectural discourse and production.</p>
