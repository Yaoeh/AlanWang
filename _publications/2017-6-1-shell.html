  <b> Abstract </b>
  <p> This paper presents a continuation of research on the prototyping of multi-agent systems for architectural design with a focus on generative design as a means to improve design exploration in the context of multiple objectives and complexity. The interactive design framework focuses on coupling force, environmental constraints and fabrication parameters as design drivers for the form finding of shell structures. The objective of the research is to enable designers to intuitively generate free form shells structures that are conditioned by multiple objectives for architectural exploration in early stages of design. The generated geometries are explored through reciprocal frames, and are evaluated in an automated fashion both on local and global levels in terms of their structural and environmental performance and constructability. The analytical results along with fabrication constraints are fed back into the generative design process in order to more rapidly and expansively design explore across complexly coupled objectives. The paper describes the framework and presents the application of this methodology for the design of fabrication aware shell structures in which environmental and structural trade offs drive the final set of design options.</p>
