<b> Abstract </b>
<p> Collecting and analyzing psychological and environmental data to build an occupant behavior model and pairing them with targeted interventions can result in increased occupant energy efficiency, productivity, and well-being. Specifically, lighting has been shown to drastically influence these factors in occupants; however, lighting’s effects on occupant emotion and occupancy as time series data have not been explored. As a result, in this paper, we explore the effects of lighting on occupants’ emotion and occupancy over time using a system of LED lights, webcams, and Raspberry Pi’s. We gauge occupant emotion and occupancy changes by alternating the brightness and color of a light strip located on their work space, and analyze their emotional state through the webcam image feeds. The results of this study show, on average, the color red is associated with the highest occupancy ratios, the color yellow with the highest engagement, and the color blue with the highest valence.</p>
